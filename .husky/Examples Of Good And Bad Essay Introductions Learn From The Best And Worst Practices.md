### Example 1: An Introduction for an Argumentative Essay on Animal Testing
 
*Every year, millions of animals are subjected to cruel and painful experiments in the name of science. These experiments are often conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of new drugs, cosmetics, and other products. However, many people argue that animal testing is unethical, unnecessary, and unreliable. They claim that alternative methods, such as computer simulations, cell cultures, and human volunteers, can provide better results without harming animals. In this essay, I will argue that animal testing should be banned because it violates animal rights, causes animal suffering, and produces unreliable data.*
  
### Example 2: An Introduction for a Narrative Essay on a Memorable Trip
 
*It was a sunny day in July 2019 when I boarded the plane to Paris with my best friend. We had been planning this trip for months, and we were both excited and nervous. We had never traveled abroad before, and we didn't know what to expect. Little did we know that this trip would change our lives forever. In this essay, I will tell you about the most memorable experiences we had in Paris, and how they shaped our friendship and our outlook on life.*
  
### Example 3: An Introduction for a Compare and Contrast Essay on Two Movies
 
*The Hunger Games and Divergent are two popular dystopian novels that have been adapted into blockbuster movies. Both stories feature a young female protagonist who lives in a futuristic society where people are divided into factions based on their abilities or traits. Both stories also involve a rebellion against a tyrannical government that oppresses the people. However, despite these similarities, there are also significant differences between the two stories in terms of plot, characters, themes, and messages. In this essay, I will compare and contrast The Hunger Games and Divergent in terms of these aspects.*
